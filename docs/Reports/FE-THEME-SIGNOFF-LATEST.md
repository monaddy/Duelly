# FE Theme — SIGNOFF (20251018-223017)

**Preview:** <http://104.238.172.232:4173> | **Probe:** <http://104.238.172.232:4173/theme-probe.html>

## Decision
- ✅ **Sign off:** *Preview fallback* (theme.css) is acceptable for merge **in preview only**.
- ⛔ **Production unchanged:** Fallback is **not** loaded in prod; removal planned once Tailwind generates the target utilities.

## Scope & Rationale
- Utilities covered: `.bg-accent`, `.bg-accent/60`, `.bg-surface/60`, `.text-fg`.
- Visual check passed on probe page (HTTP 200); contrast & stacking reviewed at a smoke‑test level.
- No CSS regressions observed; selectors are namespaced and non‑invasive.

## Artifacts
- QA Results: [docs/Reports/FE-THEME-QA-RESULTS.md](docs/Reports/FE-THEME-QA-RESULTS.md)  |  JSON: [docs/Reports/FE-THEME-QA-RESULTS.json](docs/Reports/FE-THEME-QA-RESULTS.json)
- Delivery (bundle + capture): [docs/Reports/FE-THEME-DELIVERY-LATEST.md](docs/Reports/FE-THEME-DELIVERY-LATEST.md)
- Handoff note: [docs/Reports/FE-THEME-HANDOFF-LATEST.md](docs/Reports/FE-THEME-HANDOFF-LATEST.md)

## Next Steps (Removal Plan)
1. Add Tailwind config entries for the above utilities.
2. Verify generation in CI preview and remove `theme.css` fallback.
3. Re-run probe and update FE-THEME-QA-RESULTS.md.
